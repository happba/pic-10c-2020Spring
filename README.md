## Description
A game inspired by Gold Miner to simulate the process of class enrollment.
The basic design resembles the popular game, Gold Miners. 
In this game, a player will earn GPA by selecting different levels of college courses in order to graduate. There will be a student (represented by a Bruin) in the top middle of the user interface and a hook (a fishing pole) that can be extended and pulled back to grab courses (potentially a card that shows course name and GPA). The class labels, each consisting of a course name and the corresponding GPA, are randomly scattered in the bottom of the game interface. A timer, 60s, will be displayed on the top right of the interface, which will show the remaining time in the current round. There will also be a display of the playerâ€™s cumulative GPA score and the number of classes that has been taken in the current round.

## Instruction
4 Rounds - each round represents one year 
Units determine the size of classes. Grades determine the position of classes. 
The combination of units and grades determines the speed of fetching the classes back 
If not catching two classes or accumulative GPA less than 2, Game over 
If your total GPA is higher than 2, congrats! You will graduate!
